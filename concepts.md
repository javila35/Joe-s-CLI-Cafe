# Joe's Cafe CLI

## Using faker
    - Generate coffee origins + notes.
        -https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/blob/master/lib/faker/default/coffee.rb
    - Generate random customers names
        -https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/blob/master/lib/faker/default/name.rb

## Using Queue.new
    - Can I keep adding drinks to the queue while the queue thread is running?
    - When and where do I need to call the queue? During read? During order output? During adding order?
